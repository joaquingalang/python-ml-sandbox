# 🐍 Python ML Sandbox 🧠
This repository serves as a sandbox environment for me to test and experiment with the different tools offered by machine learning and data analysis related python librariesa as I progress through the [Machine Learning Scientist](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python) carrer-track in [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

The python libraries included in the repositories include:
* numpy
* pandas
